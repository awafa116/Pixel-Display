# Pixel Art Display

I started learning arduino lately, and I made few robots using different sensors and servo motors (including one that gives you the middle finger *-* ). But I wanted to make something more creative and artistic, so I thought, what can be better than LEDs !!
so I made this " 7x7 Pixel art display " using Arduino UNO, led strips and some other materials. 
Here is how I made it .

## Making the box

- **I started by making the pixels grid using foam boards.**  
I cut 7 strips with 14 LED units on each of them (every pixel will have two LEDs).  
Then I cut a square foam board then stuck the 7 LED strips on it with equal gaps between them.
Then I started measuring the horizontal and vertical gaps, then I devided them to produce 49 equal squares (7x7), then I started to hot glue foam board parriers to seperate the pixels from each others.

- **after that I started making the frozen glass panel**  
I cut a square piece of acrylic glass sheet, then I covered it with matte wrapping film on one side, and diffuser plastic sheets on the other side. which gave it a nor-reflective surface, and made it difuse the light emitted from the LEDs as well.



I started by making the outer box using MDF, which I discovered later that it wasn't the best choice due to it's heavy weight (about 5kg).

later I covered the mdf with white
